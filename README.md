AtliQ Grands Business Intelligence and Data Analytics
Welcome to the AtliQ Grands Business Intelligence and Data Analytics project on GitHub! This initiative is aimed at helping AtliQ Grands, a prominent player in the Indian hospitality industry, regain its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. With over two decades of experience in the hospitality sector, AtliQ Grands is determined to leverage the power of data-driven insights to reclaim its position.

Project Overview
AtliQ Grands has faced challenges in recent years, including increased competition and suboptimal decision-making. To address these issues, the managing director of AtliQ Grands recognized the need to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" into their operations. However, they lacked an in-house data analytics team to provide these critical insights.

As a solution, the revenue management team decided to collaborate with a third-party service provider to extract valuable insights from their historical data. A Power BI dashboard was created as part of this effort, serving as a powerful tool to visualize and analyze data, enabling informed decision-making.
